This project is my own implementation of the degrees project in the CS50 Artificial Intelligence course.
Degrees is a simple game. It relates two different actors inputted by the user through other actors they
have worked together with. Check out the link down below for a more detailed explanation.

Degrees is a search based agent that finds the shortest path between two actors from the csv files in 
the 'large' and 'small' folders (provided by cs50). 

to run this project from your terminal use the command 'python degrees.py <directory name>' with the 
directory name being either large or small. 

Note that distribution code was provided for this project. To see distribution code or know more about
